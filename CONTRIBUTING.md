# Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please discuss what you would like to change using issues. If a large unplanned pull-request is received, it probably won't be accepted.

## Pull Requests

1. **Use `gofmt` on all your code.**
2. Make sure all dependencies being used, with appropriate versioning, is added to the glide.yaml file.
3. Make sure all the tests still pass.
4. Make a pull request onto the [develop branch](https://github.com/samwalls/fullmonte/tree/develop).
5. I will review the changes, if everything is good it will be merged into the develop branch, and then into master at a later date as part of an update.

## Feature Branches

If a large feature needs to be worked on, or would be useful to distribute across machines for testing, a remote feature branch might be in order. This is to be discussed and added as necessary. The feature will be named `feature/[name]` according roughly to the git-flow process.
